POKEMON MYSTERY DUNGEON: Grey Rescue Team (also known as ai_pmd)
Hey there. I wanted to try something different, and make my own AI-based show like AI_SPONGE and AI_SPONGE Rehydrated, while putting my own spin on it.

CONTROLS:
* Stream: suggest a topic with “!topic [TOPIC HERE]”, make weird events happen with commands like !banana and !pipis, and other stuff. You can include the playing of Youtube music in your prompts like this: “!topic Grovyle tricks Wigglytuff into playing [dQw4w9WgXcQ], stating that it’s a love song.” There are built-in tracks like [TobyFoxSquidward] and [WikipediaCBTCensored], which can be played. ”!topic Chatot plays [TobyFoxSquidward] on a jukebox and talks about the flanderization of Spongebob.”
* Streamer: capture directly from Unity 3D. ChatGPT generates the story based on the topic currently at the top of the queue. Events are handled by Unity.

Characters (so far):
* K. the Feraligatr: forgetful ex-human filled with DETERMINATION. Prefers not to go by his full first name, Kaidyn. Leader of team Cheri-Team.
* Raphael the Torterra: timid, but brave friend of K.
* Wigglytuff: easygoing and somewhat naive guildmaster of Wigglytuff’s Guild.
* Chatot: childish assistant and bestfriend of Wigglytuff.
* Grovyle: ex-criminal that tried to stop the dark future he lives in, even if that meant nearly freezing time.
* Dusknoir: Grovyle’s partner in crime.
* Grovyle (RescueFell AU) (or Fell!Grovyle): criminal that succeeded in freezing time.
* RescueFell!Dusknoir: stuck in a bleak future.
* PMD!Spamton: a Porygon rated [number#1salesman1997].

Areas:
* Treasure Town
* Beach Cave
* Drenched Bluff
* Temporal Tower
* Wigglytuff’s Guild

Events:
* !arceus - Arceus appears
* !banana - banana peel
* !froggit - Froggit spawns.
And many more…

coming soon!
